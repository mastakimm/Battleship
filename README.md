# Battleship

## Project Overview
This project involves taking over and completing an unfinished codebase left by a previous developer. The main tasks include debugging and finishing the implementation.

# Key Points:

    Code Review: Thoroughly review all the included files and familiarize with third-party libraries used.
    Good Practices: The previous developer implemented good architectural practices and left comments and documentation.
    Atomic Commits: Make frequent, small commits to ensure easy rollback if needed.

# Restrictions:

    JSLint Compliance: Ensure all submitted code is JSLint valid (http://www.jslint.com/).
    Header Directives: Do not change the header directives in the files unless absolutely necessary and justifiable.
    Code Understanding: Be prepared to explain any part of the code during the presentation.
